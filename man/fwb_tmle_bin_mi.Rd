\title{A wrapper for fractional weighted bootstrap TMLE with multiply imputed data via MICE}
\usage{
fwb_tmle_bin_mi(
  treatment_models,
  or_models,
  treatment_name,
  metalearner_treatment = NULL,
  metalearner_outcome = NULL,
  trim_ipw = NULL,
  n_bstrap = 5000,
  fluctuation_family = gaussian(),
  y_bounds = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{treatment_name}{he name of the treatment variable. Has to have values in {1, 0}.}

\item{metalearner_treatment}{If the treatment model is of class LazySL, which metalearner is to be used. If NULL and the ensemble is cross-validated, defaults to the best metalearner.}

\item{metalearner_outcome}{Which metalearner is to be used. If NULL and the ensemble is cross-validated, defaults to the best metalearner.}

\item{trim_ipw}{Specifies how weights are to be trimmed. NULL does no trimming. "gruber" applies the data-adaptive method provided by Gruber et al. (2022).}

\item{n_bstrap}{The number of bootstrap samples used to estimate the variance of the influence curve.}

\item{fluctuation_family}{Family object used for targeting. Should match the way the outcome was fit originally.}

\item{y_bounds}{Two-length vector. If the outcome was rescaled to be in \link{0, 1}, the upper and lower bounds used. Will rescale estimands accordingly.}

\item{treatment_model}{An object of class LazySL_CV or weightthem. For LazySL_CV objects, applying "predict" to individual ensembles should provide estimated propensity scores.}

\item{or_model}{An object of class LazySL. Applying "predict" should provide estimates depending on the value provided to treatment_name.}
}
\value{
